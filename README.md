## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be met in order to use this product:

* The host running the utility must have Internet access.
* The host running the utility must have the following software installed and its commands to be available in your command search PATHs:
    + curl  
      For interacting with GitLab and GitHub's API.
    + grep  
      sed  
      For parsing the curl command's output.
    + jq  
      For parsing the JSON response of GitLab and GitHub's API.

## Environment variables that can change the utility's behaviors

The following environment variables can be used to change the utility's behaviors according to your needs:

### GITLAB_NAMESPACE

GitLab namespace to replace push mirroring settings, currently namespaces including subgroup is not supported.

### GITHUB_NAMESPACE

GitHub namespace to configure push mirroring to.

### GITLAB_API_ENDPOINT

The GitLab REST API v4-compatible endpoint to use.

**Default value:** `https://gitlab.com/api/v4`

### GITHUB_API_ENDPOINT

The GitHub API v2022-11-28-compatible endpoint to use.

**Default value:** `https://api.github.com`

## Header variables that can change the utility's behaviors

The following variables can be used to change the utility's behaviors, however they can only be set by directly editing the header portion of the utility script due to sensitive nature:

### GITLAB_PAT

The personal access token with access to the GitLab namespace.  *REQUIRED.*

**Default value:** (unset)

### GITHUB_PAT

The personal access token with access to the GitHub namespace.  This can be use to mitigate GitHub rate limiting.  *OPTIONAL.*

**Default value:** (unset)

Required permission: Repository permissions > Metadata (Read-only).

## Logic

The following documents the logic of this utility in operation:

1. A list of all GitLab projects in a namespace is queried via GitLab's REST API.
1. For each GitLab project:
    1. Determine the URL of the corresponding GitHub project(repository).
    1. Check whether the GitHub project actually exists.
    1. If the project exists in the specified GitHub namespace, check whether the GitLab project has an repository mirroring configuration against it.
    1. If the repository mirroring configuration exists, remove the configuration.
    1. Create a new repository mirroring configuration with the updated GitHub PAT.
